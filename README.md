## Reflection
While working on this assignement I've learned how to setup a repsoritory with actual structure, create milestones, and how to document issues. I've aslo learned how to assign AND link tasks to deadlines using the github issues tab. I haven't had that much of a challenge as I have prior experience with Github.
